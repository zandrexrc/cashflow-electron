# Cashflow

Cashflow is an app that helps you keep track of your finances.

</div>

This is the official Electron implementation of the [Cashflow project](https://github.com/zandrexrc/cashflow).

## Install

First, clone the repo via git and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zandrexrc/cashflow-electron.git
cd cashflow-electron
yarn
```

## Starting Development

### Running the app

Start the app in the `dev` environment:

```bash
yarn start
```

### About the database files

There are two database files located in _src/database_. Initially, both of them
are empty (tables are already defined, but no data yet).  
We're going to be saving data in the _cashflow.db_ database file,
while _cashflow-empty.db_ will remain empty so we can use it to reset our data if needed.  
It may also be helpful to add the _cashflow.db_ file to _.gitignore_ to prevent git from tracking it.

## Packaging for Production

To package for the local platform:

```bash
yarn package
```
